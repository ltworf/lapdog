# lapdog can manage multiple devices, each of them must
# have their own configuration file in /etc/lapdog/

# hw address of the device
hw=00:00:00:00:00:00

# The counters indicate how many retries lapdog will do
# before running the disappear action, and the initial value
# of the counter.
#
# When a device responds to a ping, it's counter is set to 0
# when it doesn't respond, the counter is increased by one, until
# it is equal to max_misses.
#
# The actions are executed only when the counter changes to 0 or
# changes to max_misses. Which means that the appear action is only
# executed once, when the device appears, and then not repeated until
# the device disappears and appears again.
# Same holds for the disappear action.
#
# By setting the initial count to 0, if the device is present when
# lapdog is started, the appear action will not be executed. By setting
# it to a different value it will be executed.
#
# By setting the initial count to a value greater than max_misses,
# the same will happen but for the disappear action.
#
# To change the sleep time between pings, see the /etc/lapdog.conf file
initial_count=1
max_misses=5


# The commands will run in a shell. Aliases for true and false will
# be defined to run actions depending on the status of other devices.
#
# For example if there are devices defined as router_home and router_work
# then a valid action could be:
# on_appear_action=if router_home || router_work then echo "known place"; fi
# This means that you must be careful with the names you give to the devices

# Command to run when the device appears
on_appear_action=echo "OK" > /tmp/comp3status

# Command to run when the device disappears
on_disappear_action=echo "GONE" > /tmp/device_status



# uid to use to run the commands, conflicts with user, don't use both
# uid=1001

# user to use to run the commands, conflicts with uid, don't use both
user=ltworf


# Uncomment to mark the device as gateway.
# Once at least one device is marked as gateway, lapdog will require
# at least one gateway device to be online before sending pings to
# locate the missing devices.
# This is intended to disable lapdog on portable devices that could connect
# to various networks.
# Multiple devices can be marked as gateways
# gateway=true
