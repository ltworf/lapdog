Description: Take actions when specific devices appear/disappear from your LAN.
 lapdog is a service that monitors the presence/absence of the devices on your
 LAN and executes some actions accordingly.
 .
 It pings the devices to discover if they are connected or not. And uses their
 MAC address and not their IP, so it works on networks with DHCP.
